# Grunt-playlist log
### Day 4: August 31, 2017    

**Today's Progress**:   
1. Today I learnt how to install grunt-cli and grunt

**Thoughts**:     
1. I must install grunt with the npm and as option "--save-dev" to save it as devDependencies  
2. The grunt file must be a module, and it should be exported (module.exports= function(){})
